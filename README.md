# Energy-Optimization-in-Real-Time-Systems

The proposed work shows the optimization of energy consumption in battery-operated real time systems. A suitable scheduling algorithm Least Slack TIme was proposed that could work well with power management techniques that include Dynamic Power Managanement(DPM) Dynamic Voltage Scaling(DVS), and the combination of both. The implementation is shown in the respective fields. The results are discussed thoroughly in Energy Optimization.pdf
Python was used for simulation. One alternate option to python is MATLAB.
